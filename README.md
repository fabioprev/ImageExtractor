ImageExtractor
=========

This software package extracts the MRI patient brain scans from the data sets ADNI or OASIS.
The code has been developed by using Matlab R2012b but the code should be compatible also with
newer Matlab versions.

# Usage

Open Matlab and import the ImageExtractor software package. Then type the following command:

  - imageExtractor(\<dataset-name\>,\<dataset-path\>) - e.g., imageExtractor('adni','/home/fabio/IASI-CNR/Datasets/ADNI/')
